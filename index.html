        <p>
            I am a second year computer science student. Outside of 
            school, I enjoy going clubs like Rotaract. The motto for Rotaract is
        "Service Above Self". </p>
        <p>I am a big foodie, I am very passsionate about trying new foods from different 
        different cultures. I really enjoy baklawa from the Lebanese cuisine and sushi from the 
        Japanese cuisine but my favorite cuisine of all time is defintely the Jamaican cuisine. Nothing
        hits home like some good Jamaican food. </p>
        
        <p>Apart fom food, 
            I am interested in Web Development. This is because I get to bring my
            creative thoughts to life using different web systems and tools. Additionally, I've 
            always been interested in UI and applications like : Figma. Thus, I believe this is an amazing opportunity 
            to explore that interest.
